memset: Sets the first num bytes of the block of memory pointed by ptr to the specified value (interpreted as an unsigned char

SO fast: as it directly assign memory blocks.

You could set with it chars in case string, 0 or 1 in case integers and -1 in case doubles.

memset(vis, 0, sizeof(vis));    sizeof()= number of interger *size_in_byte                                                 
memset (str,'-',6);                          string
