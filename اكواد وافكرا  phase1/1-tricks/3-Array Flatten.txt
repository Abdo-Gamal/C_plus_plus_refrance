Say we have 2D array R*C, and we want to convert it to 1D array of R*C elements

	then for any (i, j) zero based: we have i rows before us, each of C elements. In current row, j elements.
	then (i, j) = i * C + j			(note j < C)

	what if we have index X in 1 D, and want to convert it to its 2D?
	we know X = i * C + j
		then X%C = (i * C % C + j % C)%C = j         //i*c%c=0 && as j<c then j%c=j
			 X/C = i*C / C + j/C = i              //j/c=0 as j<c  


What about X*Y*Z?(راجع*)

	Then (i, j, k) = i * Y * Z + j * Z + k	-> Each term * Multiplication of next dimensions كل متغير اضربة فى كل الابعاد الى اقل منة 

	What about Index?
		You have 2 ways: Think left or right?

	From Right?( اسهل )
		Index%Z = i * Y * Z + j * Z + k = 0 + 0 + k
		Index/Z = i * Y + j + 0		= Index2

		then
			Index2%Y = 0 + j
			Index2/Y = i

    (anther away*)From left
		Index % (Y*Z) = 0 + j*Z + k
		Index / (Y*Z) = i + 0 + 0

		and so on

	Coding wise, the processing from left and ranking (i, j, k) are similar
