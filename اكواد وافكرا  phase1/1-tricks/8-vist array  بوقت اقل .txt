Say you have for every given test case, to mark some numbers in boolean visited array, and check who is marked later.
	Unfortunately array is of Million number and you have many test cases. Code TLE due to memseting each test case. Using set to mark also TLE.

Here is a nice trick. Instead of bool vis[], we will use int vis[], and we will never memset it, default zeros)
	Say we are in t-th test case.
		Mark a visited number with T:		vis[i] = T;
		Check if a cell is visited with 	if(vis[i] == T)
مش هصفر الاررى   كل الى هعملة انى 
		Intially T = 1, which is default we do. Say in Test Case 1, we marked 2, 5: Then array of 10 is: {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0}
		In Test T=2, every number != T is not visited, so whole array is FALSE for us.
		Now mark 5, 7 and 8: {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0}	and so on
