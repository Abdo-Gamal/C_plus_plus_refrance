 -------------------------------------------------- Thinking - On papers Not on PC ---------------------------------------------------

Remember the comofortable zone? When you move from Easy to meduim to hard problem. you suffer more.
	The more compleixy of problem, the MORE thinking you nee about it.


One of main problems is that coders loves the PCs and loves solving over the machine. 
	In many cases, this push them to write the solution, without doing all necessary steps first (e.g. verifying idea/order)
	The mind will be bounded on PC and will keep doing "work arounds" to fix idea/code.

It is much better to think on papers away of the PC. Skeptch FULL idea and verify it.

Same for implementation of a hard problem, you think more about code before writing it.

Yourself will tell you coding on PC is faster, tell her NO, this is not easy idea/code for me.

If you sketched a code/idea and later discovered a mistake in it! LEFT the machine.
	Back to paper, repeat your life cycle. NEVER to think on PC.
	
	
Finally, In Real ICPC contest, Teams are of 3, with 1 pc. When you think on paper, you save team time.
