 * 	2- In many problems, function F is boolean function could(int val).	
                                     E.g. If we are given # of sandwiches to eat during trip. Using them you could reach your destination or die from starving as food ended.
 * 			What is MIN # of sandwiches to finish trip and still alive?
 *
 * 		in this case space is like  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
 *
 * 			That is e.g. given up to 6 sandwiches u die, but more than that you could pass.
 *
 * 		Sometimes space is reverse 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
 *
 * 		Sometimes you are asked for first 1 (or) zero and some times you are asked for the last.
 *
 * 		For more understanding for first and last: Imagine array: 1 3 4 5 9 9 9 12 15 ...
 * 			Find 1st idx of 9? Find last idx of 9?
 * 			So it is not just about finding, but which position? any? first? last?
 *
 * 		Final note: remember (e.g. in 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1) the last zero followed by the first one. So you could be asked to last, and solve it usign first.
